okay so this is as ******** as possible

YOU NEED PYTHON 3.4 AND G++ IN YOUR PATH KTHXBYE

I only wrote it to easily deal with tasks from main.edu.pl platform

I think it doesn't care about stderr but if it does why would it matter

you just create a directory (for example `ban`) then put your code in it as `<directory name>.cpp` (`ban.cpp`) and then add tests to the directory so that every input file has `.in` file extension and for every input file there's a matching `.out` file

what actually happens is you `mkdir sdfiojhirougfe` then save your code as `sdfiojhirougfe/sdfiojhirougfe.cpp` and then just drop all these `.in` and `.out` files from MAIN platform into `sdfiojhirougfe`

you're welcome
